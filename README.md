# Scan-and-Enumeration
<br><b> Scanning a machine to Enumerate Vulnerabilities</b></br>
<br>Finding vulnerabilities in a machine is a slow and manual process. I wrote some bash scripts long time back, and I am sharing with the communities now. These scripts will scan using nmap and gather data to enumerate a machine. You can change name of directories and provide a list of IPs for generating a list of files for you. In case you need any help, you can contact me @ saqib100@hotmail.com. </br>

Note: I have tested these scripts on Kali Linux. You can download Kali Linux virtual images from https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/
