# Scan-and-Enumeration

<b> Scanning a machine to Enumerate Vulnerabilities</b>
<br>Finding vulnerabilities in a machine is a slow and manual process. I wrote some bash scripts long time back, and I am sharing with the communities now. These scripts will scan using nmap and gather data to enumerate a machine. You can change name of directories and provide a list of IPs for generating a list of files for you. In case you need any help, you can contact me @ saqib100@hotmail.com. </br>
